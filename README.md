# SoccerCPD : Formation and Role Change Point Detection  

This repository contains a report and some code experiments on the paper [SoccerCPD: Formation and Role Change-Point Detection in Soccer Matches Using Spatiotemporal Tracking Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10926) by Kim et al., KDD 2022. 
This project was done as part of the M2- Machine Learning for Time Series course, with my teammate Omar El Mansouri.
